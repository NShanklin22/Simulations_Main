# PROJECT REFACTORING PLAN

## Overview
Refactor algorithm visualization codebase to reduce bloat, improve maintainability, and enable easier feature additions.

## Phase 1 - Core Architecture (High Priority)

### 1.1 State Pattern Implementation
- [ ] Create `IAppState` interface with virtual methods: `handleEvents()`, `update()`, `render()`, `onEnter()`, `onExit()`
- [ ] Create `MenuAppState` class implementing menu functionality
- [ ] Create `QuicksortAppState` class implementing quicksort simulation
- [ ] Create `AStarAppState` class implementing A* pathfinding
- [ ] Create `StateManager` class to handle state transitions
- [ ] Update `Application` class to use `StateManager` instead of switch statements
- [ ] Remove `AppState` enum and related switch logic
- [ ] Test state transitions work correctly

### 1.2 MenuFactory Implementation  
- [ ] Create `IMenuFactory` interface with `createMenu()` method
- [ ] Create `MenuFactory` class with methods: `createMainMenu()`, `createSortingMenu()`, `createPathfindingMenu()`, `createSettingsMenu()`, `createSoundBoardMenu()`
- [ ] Extract menu item creation logic from `MenuSystem` into factory methods
- [ ] Update `MenuSystem` to use factory for menu creation
- [ ] Remove menu initialization methods from `MenuSystem`
- [ ] Test all menus still function correctly

**Phase 1 Completion Criteria**: No switch statements in Application.cpp, MenuSystem only handles rendering/navigation, all state logic encapsulated in dedicated classes.

## Phase 2 - Data & Separation (Medium Priority)

### 2.1 Config Migration
- [ ] Create `config/quicksort_demo.json` with array generation parameters
- [ ] Create `config/astar_demo.json` with grid layout and obstacles
- [ ] Update demo initialization to read from config files
- [ ] Remove hardcoded demo data from Application.cpp

### 2.2 MenuSystem Split
- [ ] Create `MenuRenderer` class for UI rendering logic
- [ ] Create `MenuNavigation` class for keyboard input handling
- [ ] Create `MenuAudio` class for sound effects
- [ ] Update `MenuSystem` to compose these components
- [ ] Test menu functionality unchanged

### 2.3 Polymorphic Dispatch
- [ ] Replace remaining switch statements with virtual method calls
- [ ] Ensure consistent interface across all states

## Phase 3 - Cleanup (Low Priority)

### 3.1 TODO Resolution
- [ ] Review all TODO comments in codebase
- [ ] Implement or remove incomplete features
- [ ] Document decisions for removed features

## Success Metrics
- Application.cpp reduced from 305 to ~150 lines
- MenuSystem.cpp reduced from 401 to ~200 lines
- Zero switch statements on AppState
- All existing functionality preserved
- New simulation types can be added with <50 lines of code

## Potential Future Simulations

### Scientific/Mathematical Simulations
- **Body Fat Addition/Burn**: Interactive visualization showing calorie intake vs expenditure effects on body composition over time
- **Compound Interest**: Visual demonstration of investment growth with different rates, time periods, and contribution schedules

### Additional Algorithm Categories
- **Graph Algorithms**: Dijkstra, BFS, DFS
- **Data Structures**: Binary tree operations, heap operations
- **Physics**: Particle systems, wave propagation
- **Economics**: Supply/demand curves, market dynamics

## Rollback Plan
Each phase creates new classes alongside existing code. Rollback by reverting to original Application/MenuSystem classes if issues arise.
