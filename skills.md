# C++ Skills Progression

This document lists C++ skills required for proficiency, added only after they are used in a project phase. Skills are organized by project phase, with each entry including a brief description or example.

## Phase 1: Basic Project Structure and SFML Window Setup

- **Project Structure & File Organization**
  - Understanding of organizing code into `src/`, `include/`, `assets/`, and configuration folders for modularity and maintainability.

- **C++17 Basics**
  - Use of C++17 standard features (e.g., `auto`, range-based for loops, structured bindings).

- **CMake Build System**
  - Writing and understanding `CMakeLists.txt` to configure and build C++ projects.

- **SFML Setup and Integration**
  - Linking and initializing SFML libraries for graphics, window, and system modules.

- **Main Function and Entry Point**
  - Implementing the `main()` function as the application entry point.

- **Basic Window Management**
  - Creating and displaying a window using SFML.

- **Header and Source File Separation**
  - Defining classes in header files (`.h`) and implementing them in source files (`.cpp`).

- **Namespaces**
  - Using namespaces to organize code and prevent naming conflicts.

_Skills for later phases will be added as they are used in the project._
