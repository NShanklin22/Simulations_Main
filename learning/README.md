# C++ Learning & Practice Area

This folder contains practice exercises, code examples, and learning materials to build C++ skills needed for the main simulation project.

## Folder Structure

### `/basics/`
- **Purpose**: Fundamental C++ concepts
- **Topics**: Variables, functions, classes, basic syntax
- **Goal**: Build foundation before tackling main project

### `/intermediate/`
- **Purpose**: Project-relevant C++ features
- **Topics**: Memory management, STL containers, file I/O, templates
- **Goal**: Skills directly applicable to simulation app

### `/advanced/`
- **Purpose**: Optimization and advanced techniques
- **Topics**: Move semantics, smart pointers, performance optimization
- **Goal**: Polish and efficiency improvements

### `/exercises/`
- **Purpose**: Hands-on practice problems
- **Topics**: Small programs that mirror main project components
- **Goal**: Practice before implementing in main codebase

## Learning Path Recommendation

1. **Start with basics/** - Get comfortable with C++ syntax
2. **Practice in exercises/** - Build small programs
3. **Apply to main project** - Use concepts in real implementation
4. **Return to intermediate/advanced** - Improve and optimize

## Quick Reference Files
- `cpp_concepts.md` - Key concepts summary
- `project_patterns.md` - Code patterns used in main project
- `troubleshooting.md` - Common issues and solutions

## Practice Projects in `/exercises/`
- Simple menu system
- Basic graphics window (SFML intro)
- Array manipulation and visualization
- Configuration file reading/writing
- Theme color management

This approach lets you experiment safely without affecting the main project!
